<H2>Hermite Polynomials</H2>
<P id=3DForeword>Charles Hermite (1822-1901) gave us these polynomials, =
famous in=20
the quantum mechanics of the harmonic oscillator
<HR>

<P></P>
<P>A polynomial is a finite sum of terms like =
a<SUB>k</SUB>x<SUP>k</SUP>, where=20
k is a positive integer or zero. There are sets of polynomials such that =
the=20
product of any two different ones, multiplied by a function w(x) called =
a=20
<I>weight function</I> and integrated over a certain interval, vanishes. =
Such a=20
set is called a set of orthogonal polynomials. Among other things, this =
makes it=20
possible to expand an arbitrary function f(x) as a sum of the =
polynomials, each=20
multiplied by a coefficient c(k), which is easily and uniquely =
determined by=20
integration. A Fourier series is similar, but the orthogonal functions =
are not=20
polynomials. These functions can also be used to specify basis states in =
quantum=20
mechanics, which must be orthogonal.</P>
<P>The Hermite polynomials H<SUB>n</SUB>(x) are orthogonal on the =
interval from=20
-=E2=88=9E to +=E2=88=9E with respect to the weight function w(x) =3D =
exp(x<SUP>2</SUP>). [exp (x)=20
=3D e<SUP>x</SUP>] Surprisingly, this is sufficient to determine the =
polynomials=20
up to a multiplicative factor. Let's start with the expression =
H<SUB>n</SUB> =3D=20
exp(x<SUP>2</SUP>)(d<SUP>n</SUP>/dx<SUP>n</SUP>)exp(-x<SUP>2</SUP>). We =
notice=20
that each differentiation will bring down a factor -2x, and that the =
exponential=20
will survive in each term. Each term will contain the factor =
exp(-x<SUP>2</SUP>)=20
that will be cancelled by the exponential in front. Therefore, the =
result will=20
be a polynomial of degree n, and the leading term will be =
(-2x)<SUP>n</SUP>. The=20
powers of x will either be all even or all odd, as well. Moreover, the =
form of=20
this definition will guarantee that the polynomials belonging to =
different=20
values of n are orthogonal. It is, in fact, a Rodrigues' formula, like =
those=20
used to define other kinds of orthogonal polynomials.</P>
<P>An alternative definition uses the weight function w(x) =3D=20
exp(x<SUP>2</SUP>/2) instead. Then, He<SUB>n</SUB> =3D=20
exp(x<SUP>2</SUP>/2)(d<SUP>n</SUP>/dx<SUP>n</SUP>)exp(-x<SUP>2</SUP>/2), =
where=20
the notation He is used instead of H to make the different weight =
function=20
clear. Of course, the corresponding polynomials will be very similar, =
and one=20
could be used as well as the other, with appropriate changes of =
variable. In=20
this case, each differentiation brings down the simpler factor (-x), so =
that the=20
coefficient of x<SUP>n</SUP> is (-1)<SUP>n</SUP>. In fact, the usual =
definitions=20
include the (-1)<SUP>n</SUP> factor, so that the coefficient of =
x<SUP>n</SUP> is=20
always positive. Of three classic references (see References), Jackson =
uses He,=20
Pauling and Wilson H, and both are given in Abramowitz and Stegun. The=20
possibilities of confusion are not as great as in the case of Laguerre=20
polynomials.</P>
<P>The H polynomials are H<SUB>0</SUB> =3D 1, H<SUB>1</SUB> =3D 2x, with =
the=20
recursion relation H<SUB>n+1</SUB>(x) =3D 2xH<SUB>n</SUB>(x) -=20
2nH<SUB>n-1</SUB>(x), and they satisfy the differential equation =
H"<SUB>n</SUB>=20
-2xH'<SUB>n</SUB> + 2nH<SUB>n</SUB> =3D 0.</P>
<P>The He polynomials are He<SUB>0</SUB> =3D 1, He<SUB>1</SUB> =3D x, =
with the=20
recursion relation He<SUB>n+1</SUB> =3D xHe<SUB>n</SUB> - =
nHe<SUB>n-1</SUB>, and=20
they satisfy the differential equation He"<SUB>n</SUB> - =
xHe'<SUB>n</SUB> +=20
nHe<SUB>n</SUB> =3D 0.</P>
<P>It is of interest that y(x) =3D exp(-x<SUP>2</SUP>/2)H<SUB>n</SUB>(x) =
is a=20
solution of the differential equation y" + (2n + 1 - x<SUP>2</SUP>)y =3D =
0. This=20
equation arises in the quantum mechanics of the harmonic oscillator. =
These=20
solutions are called Hermite functions, and each includes the square =
root of the=20
weight function w(x), so that the wave functions y(x) are orthogonal =
when=20
integrated from -=E2=88=9E to +=E2=88=9E, which is required by the =
theory.</P>
<P>The orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials is expressed by <IMG=20
src=3D"http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/math/herm1.gif" =
align=3DabsMiddle>, where the=20
Kronecker delta is zero if m is not equal to n, and unity if m equals n. =
To=20
prove this, simply express the exponential times the Hermite polynomial =
of=20
larger order as an nth derivative using the Rodrigues formula, then =
integrate by=20
parts until the polynomial of smaller order is differentiated to zero. =
If the=20
orders are equal, the final integral is simply the integral of=20
exp(-x<SUP>2</SUP>) times a constant, and the result is established. The =

normalization constant becomes sqrt(2=CF=80)n! for He.</P>
<P>The orthogonality can be used to expand an arbitrary function f(x) in =
a=20
series of Hermite polynomials, in exactly the same way that a Fourier =
series is=20
formed. If the expansion functions are =
exp(-x<SUP>2</SUP>/2)H<SUB>n</SUB>(x),=20
the series is called a Gram-Charlier series, and is useful in =
mathematical=20
statistics.</P>
<P>Surely the most famous use of Hermite polynomials is in the =
Schr=C3=B6dinger=20
theory of the harmonic oscillator. I will sketch the development here. =
For more=20
information, see Pauling and Wilson or Dirac, or indeed any introductory =
quantum=20
mechanics text. A model of a harmonic oscillator is a point mass m =
moving along=20
the x-axis under a restoring force -kx. The natural frequency =CE=BD is =
given by 2=CF=80=CE=BD=20
=3D =CF=89 =3D =E2=88=9A(k/m). In terms of the momentum p =3D mv the =
kinetic energy T =3D=20
p<SUP>2</SUP>/2m, and the potential energy V =3D =
m=CF=89<SUP>2</SUP>x<SUP>2</SUP>/2.=20
The Hamiltonian H(p,q) =3D T + V.</P>
<P>In quantum mechanics, the state of the oscillator is described by an=20
amplitude =CE=A8 that obeys the equation of motion =
(ih/2=CF=80)d=CE=A8/dt =3D H=CE=A8, where H is an=20
operator formed from the operators p and x. In the Schr=C3=B6dinger =
picture, the=20
state is described by the generalized coordinate x, and the momentum is =
the=20
operator p =3D -(ih/2=CF=80)d/dx. A state of definite energy E satisfies =
the relation=20
H=CE=A8 =3D E=CE=A8, and is called an <I>energy eigenstate</I>. Since H =
does not contain the=20
time, =CE=A8 can be expressed as the product of a time factor and a =
space factor =CF=88.=20
The equation of motion shows that the time factor is exp(i2=CF=80Et/h) =
for a state of=20
this kind, which represents a steady change of phase at frequency E/h. =
It is the=20
complex nature of =CE=A8 that allows it to express the complete behavior =
of the=20
oscillator with the x coordinate alone, instead of the position and =
momentum=20
separately. The operators for p and x satisfy xp - px =3D ih/2=CF=80; =
that is, they do=20
not commute, which is a fundamental property.</P>
<P>Since the time function factors out, =CF=88 satisfies H=CF=88 =3D =
E=CF=88, or=20
-(h<SUP>2</SUP>/8=CF=80<SUP>2</SUP>m)d<SUP>2</SUP>=CF=88dx<SUP>2</SUP> + =

m=CF=89<SUP>2</SUP>x<SUP>2</SUP>=CF=88/2 =3D E=CF=88. This is the =
Schr=C3=B6dinger Equation, and =CF=88(x)=20
is the Schr=C3=B6dinger wave function. If we put u =3D x=E2=88=9A=CE=B1, =
where =CE=B1 =3D 2=CF=80m=CF=89/h, this=20
equation becomes</P>
<P align=3Dcenter>d<SUP>2</SUP>=CF=88/du<SUP>2</SUP> + (2E/h=CE=BD - =
u<SUP>2</SUP>)=CF=88 =3D 0</P>
<P>From what we said above, we see that 2E/h=CE=BD =3D 2n + 1, and =
=CF=88 =3D=20
C<SUB>n</SUB>exp(-u<SUP>2</SUP>/2)H<SUB>n</SUB>(u), where C<SUB>n</SUB> =
is=20
chosen so that the integral of the square of =CF=88 from -=E2=88=9E to =
+=E2=88=9E is unity; this is=20
said to <I>normalize</I> the wave function. For energy eigenstates such =
as this,=20
we can always choose =CF=88 real. The energy of the oscillator takes the =
values E =3D=20
h=CE=BD(n + 1/2). In the ground state, n=3D 0, there remains the =
<I>zero-point</I>=20
energy h=CE=BD/2. This unexpected and quite real result was one of the =
triumphs of=20
quantum mechanics.</P>
<P>The energy eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator are by no means the =
only or=20
the usually observed states. They are mainly useful in expanding more =
general=20
states in terms of the energy eigenstates, and other theoretical =
developments.=20
In particular, it is impossible to realize a macroscopic energy =
eigenstate, so=20
we never see the nodes or the spreading in daily life. The widest =
applications=20
of this theory are to optics and radiation, incidentally.</P>
